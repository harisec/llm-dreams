Prompt for DeepSeek

```
You are tasked with generating 5 different, beautiful, and impressive stable diffusion prompts. 
These prompts should be inspired by, but distinctly different from, the following example prompts:

<example_prompts>
{{EXAMPLE_PROMPTS}}
</example_prompts>

Your goal is to create prompts that are unique, creative, and capable of producing stunning visual results. Follow these steps to generate each new prompt:

1. Analyze the structure and elements of the example prompts.
2. Identify key themes, styles, or techniques used in the examples.
3. Brainstorm new concepts, subjects, or scenes that are not directly related to the examples.
4. Incorporate vivid descriptors, artistic styles, and atmospheric elements to enhance the visual appeal.
5. Ensure each prompt is distinctly different from both the examples and the other prompts you generate.

When creating your prompts, consider the following elements:
- Subject matter (e.g., landscapes, characters, objects)
- Artistic styles (e.g., photorealistic, surrealist, abstract)
- Color palettes and lighting
- Composition and framing
- Mood and atmosphere
- Unique or unexpected combinations of elements

Generate your 5 prompts one at a time, taking care to make each one distinct and impressive. After generating each prompt, briefly review it to ensure it meets the criteria of being beautiful, impressive, and different from the examples and your other generated prompts.

Present your final output in the following format:

<generated_prompts>
1. [Your first generated prompt]
2. [Your second generated prompt]
3. [Your third generated prompt]
4. [Your fourth generated prompt]
5. [Your fifth generated prompt]
</generated_prompts>

Remember, creativity and originality are key. Push the boundaries of imagination while creating prompts that would result in visually stunning and captivating images.
